Trivial Security is not a penetration testing suite, we appreciate it is
perceived to share many features with the early stages of a penetration test and
you may find this useful as a tester, but we do not explicitly support this
methodology.

Trivial Security scanners will see your internet connected services the same ay
they are presented to anonymous malicious actors. Consider that your logged in
users has identity verification (right?), so these bad actors that are logged in
also are identified by your system and can be prosecuted.

Trivial Security aims to help you defend from the more discrete, albeit simple,
attack vectors rather than offer fraud detection or misuse by authorized users
within your system.

Trivial Security will focus entirely on bad actors who anonymously attack your
public services.
