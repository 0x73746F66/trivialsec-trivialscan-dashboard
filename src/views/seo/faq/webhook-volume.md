If your account is inactive and no monitoring is enabled, there may not be any
webhooks sent unless you also disable the early warning system or delete your
account data. For every monitored host there will be daily events generated
entirely dependant on your preferences and the state of the scan target's
security. Also all hosts you've scanned are used to derive Early Warning System
events.

Essentially the more you use Trivial Security there more potential webhook
events that can be sent, but your preferences ultimately control which events
will be sent.
