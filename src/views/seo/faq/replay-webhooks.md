If the webhook was generated and we attempted to send the data to your systems,
the log of that attempt can be accessed, data of the event viewed, and webhook
resent via the dashboard page.

If your preferences were configured at the time in such a way that when the
event occurred the webhook was not enabled, then no attempt was made to send the
webhook, no log exists because the event data was never needed and was not
generated.
