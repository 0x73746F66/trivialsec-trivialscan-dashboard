Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a family of network protocols aimed to encrypt
data transmission over other, higher level, protocols that transport web
content, email or other types of information.

Today, SSL is considered obsolete and insecure. SSL was now replaced with a
newer TLS (Transport Layer Security) family of protocols.

Many people, however, still use the SSL acronym interchangeably with TLS.

Billions of people unwittingly use SSL/TLS in a daily manner, for example, when
they visit an HTTPS website, they are relying on TLS encryption when sending and
receiving the data from the web server where the website is hosted.
