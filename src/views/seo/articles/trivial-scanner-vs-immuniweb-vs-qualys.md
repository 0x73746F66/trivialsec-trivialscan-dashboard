newly discovered assets and vulnerabilities. ImmuniWeb also offers penetration
testing, web application security testing, and mobile application security

may not meet the growing security needs in the future. Lack of PCI DSS
Compliance of Qualys SSL Labs does not provide support for organizations to
comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), which may
be important for the organisation in the future.

ImmuniWeb can offer more if the company has a large budget and a team of
dedicated IT security professionals.

-   **Comprehensive security testing**: ImmuniWeb offers a comprehensive
    security testing solution, including attack surface management, web
    application security testing, and mobile application security testing, which

    existing security infrastructure and processes, due to its API support and
    comprehensive features.
-   **Customer support**: ImmuniWeb offers excellent customer support, which is
    important for the company given its high security requirements.

Of course the cost of: ImmuniWeb is more expensive than Qualys SSL Labs, due to
its comprehensive security testing solutions and the complexity of ImmuniWeb may
be more effort to utilise, due to its comprehensive features, which may require
more resources and expertise to implement and maintain.
