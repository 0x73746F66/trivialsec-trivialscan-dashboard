                        Australia controls the export of products and
                        information. You expressly agree to comply with such
                        restrictions and not to export or re-export any of the
                        Content to countries or persons prohibited under the
                        export control laws. By downloading the Content, you are
                        expressly agreeing that you are not in a country where
                        such export is prohibited or are a person or entity for
                        which such export is prohibited. You are solely
                        responsible for compliance with the laws of your
                        specific jurisdiction regarding the import, export, or
                        re-export of the Content.

                This Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of
                Australia, without respect to its conflict of laws provisions.
                You expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal
                jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City
                of Sydney. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
                invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the
                invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of
                the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain
                in full force and effect. Failure of the Company to act on or
                enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as
                a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this
                Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against the Company
                unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as
                a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as
                expressly agreed by the Company and you, this Agreement
                constitutes the entire Agreement between you and the Company
                with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous
                or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between
                the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section
                headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be
                given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit
                of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees. Any
                information submitted or provided by you to the Web Site might
                be publicly accessible. Important and private information should
                be protected by you. The Company is not liable for protection of
                privacy of electronic mail or other information transferred
                through the Internet or any other network that you may use.
