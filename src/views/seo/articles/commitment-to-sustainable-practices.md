We are committed to promoting sustainable and eco-friendly SaaS practices.

#### Sustainable Business practices

We understand the importance of reducing energy consumption, carbon emissions,
and heat waste, and we believe that SaaS has the potential to play a significant
role in promoting sustainability.

To this end, we are committed to avoiding traditional servers and always-on
databases and instead utilizing serverless technology and cloud object storage.
This allows us to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by only
allocating the resources necessary for each task, rather than maintaining
servers and databases that are always running.

In addition, we are committed to implementing environmentally responsible
practices in all aspects of our SaaS business, including our operations, and
development processes.

#### Sustainable Software Development

An example of sustainable software development is deliberate choice for dark
theme;

##### Dark Theme

Some studies have reported that the use of dark themes in large-scale
deployments can result in significant cost savings. For example, a study by
Microsoft in 2019 found that the use of dark themes in their Office suite
resulted in an estimated annual energy savings of $250,000.

Some other studies include:

-   AMOLED Screen Study: A study by DisplayMate Technologies found that using a
    dark theme on an AMOLED screen can result in a significant reduction in
    power consumption compared to using a light theme. The study found that
    using a dark theme can result in a 30% reduction in power consumption.
-   Energy Savings and Productivity Study: A study by the Energy Policy
    Institute at the University of Chicago found that the use of dark themes can
    result in energy savings and improved productivity. The study found that
    dark themes can result in energy savings of up to 44% and improve user
    productivity by up to 50%.

The tangible benefits:

1. **Reduced energy consumption**: By reducing the power consumption of devices,
   using a dark theme can result in lower energy costs, especially in
   large-scale deployments where hundreds or thousands of devices are in use.

2. **Increased battery life**: On devices with OLED screens, using a dark theme
   can reduce the power consumption as these screens use less power to display
   black pixels. This can result in longer battery life, especially on devices
   with small batteries, like smartphones. For example, using a dark theme on a
   smartphone with an OLED screen can result in an extra hour or two of battery
   life compared to using a light theme.

Once new users to dark themes become more familiar they discover the benefits
of; Reduced eye strain, Reduced screen glare, Improved focus (less distractions
by reducing the amount of bright white light), improved contrast between text
and background, making it easier to read and navigate, Improved readability
because black text on a white background can be harder to read in low light
conditions compared to white text on a dark background, and come to love the
aesthetics of a more modern and sleek look to our software compared to the
cookie-cutter and ugly interfaces in the competitive market.

Our developers really love these outcomes, and it encourages them to make better
decisions of their own. Here are some substantial examples of how developers can
chose more sustainable technology:

##### Programming Paradigms

**On-demand vs Always On**

Serverless can reduce energy consumption by minimizing the need for physical
hardware and reducing the energy required to power and cool data centers. With
serverless, resources are only used when they are needed, and with SaaS,
applications are hosted in the cloud, reducing the need for energy-intensive
on-premise hardware.

**Eco Cloud Providers**

AWS (Amazon Web Services): AWS, one of the largest providers of cloud computing
services, has highlighted the eco-friendly benefits of serverless technology on
their website. They mention that serverless allows organizations to only pay for
the computing resources they actually use, reducing waste and improving resource
efficiency. They also mention that serverless reduces the need for physical
hardware, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.

This includes expecting renewable energy sources from our providers, their
commitment to improving energy efficiency, and encouraging sustainable behavior
among our vendors when negotiating with them.

Stripe, our payment processing company, has made a comprehensive commitment to
sustainability. They aim to reduce their carbon emissions, promote renewable
energy, improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and promote sustainability in
their offerings. They have set targets to achieve carbon neutrality in their
operations by 2030, and to use 100% renewable energy by 2040. Stripe is also
working to make their data centers and offices more energy efficient, reduce
waste in their operations, and promote sustainable practices in their offerings,
such as eco-friendly payment options and working with merchants to promote
sustainability. Through these efforts, Stripe aims to play a positive role in
promoting sustainability and contribute to a more sustainable future.

More vendors we use that as made a commitment to sustainability and promoting
environmentally responsible practices:

-   Twilio, our communications platform
-   JumpCloud, our identity and device management platform
-   Pusher.com, our real-time communication platform
-   GitLab, our Git repository manager and a complete DevOps platform
-   Odoo, our bookkeeping and CRM
-   ProtonMail, our secure email service

#### Our Journey so far

The original SaaS that was considered complete in late 2019 had all the typical
bad practices the majority of SaaS providers have today:

-   Light theme; draining user devices batter through their screen brightness
-   High energy consumption from Always On, provisioned for scale, and mostly
    under-utilized anticipating demand
-   Overly relied on in-house developed solutions for things that could be
    consuming less via shared services, and reduce our own operational and
    computational time

This iteration of Trivial Security had yet to be named, it was a series of
programs running in many containerized hosts on bare-metal always-on servers,
with a small private group of users (penetration testers, security researchers,
and consultant peers). It wastefully enumerated when it could have cycled down
awaiting user demand. The collection of programs that is now called the Early
Warning Service (EWS) alone required 100+ instances (over 300 CPU cores)
utilizing under 1% until it bursts at infrequent (often once daily) intervals.

This was unsustainable as we were consuming capital and due to our values we
knew we were not as ecological as we have hoped to be.

In early 2020 the idea of Trivial Security was born. With best wishes and
support from our early users, we decided to terminated all operations and start
fresh, holding true to our values.

#### Our culture and values

We seek out individuals who are committed to promoting environmentally
responsible practices, and working to create a more sustainable future. The team
prioritizes open communication, collaboration, and continuous improvement, in
order to achieve its sustainability goals. In this type of culture, individuals
are encouraged to bring forward new ideas, initiatives and best practices to
help reduce their environmental impact and promote sustainability. The
organization provides opportunities for team members to participate in
sustainability initiatives, such as energy-saving projects, working from home,
and green commuting options.

Overall, this type of culture fosters a supportive and empowering environment,
where everyone has a role to play in creating a more sustainable future.

We are humans in this business, we are dedicated to continuously improving our
sustainability practices. As a startup we are establishing ourselves with a
culture of commitment to promote a more sustainable future for all.
