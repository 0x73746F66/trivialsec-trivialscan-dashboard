Trivial Scanner is specifically designed to perform requests no different than
any web browsers, and will reduce volume sent after the initial scan.

Only customers with hosts that they have verified ownership can use our service
for active scanning that may have unforeseeable or potentially disruptive
activity.

If you still believe there is abuse please send an email to abuse@trivialsec.com
and provide us your logs of the activity.
