Webhooks are one way that apps can send automated messages or information to
other apps. In many cases, you'll need to know how to use webhooks if you want
to automatically push data from one app to another.

The old way apps 'talk' to one another is the app that wants data 'asks' for it,
and may get nothing, asks again, and again, and spends a lot of time asking and
getting nothing. It is consuming power, wasteful, and can even make your system
slower for no benefit. This old way is called polling.

Webhooks is the opposite, when data is available it will be sent to 'connected'
apps. Apps no longer need to 'ask', they simply get the data as soon as it is
available.

Technically, webhooks are "user-defined callbacks made with HTTP" according to
Jeff Lindsay, one of the first people to conceptualize webhooks. The quickest
way to learn is to experiment - and it's best to experiment with something you
can't break. With webhooks, there are two great tools for that: RequestBin
(owned by Pipedream) and Postman. RequestBin lets you create a webhooks URL and
send data to it to see how it's recognized. Go to RequestBin, click Create a
RequestBin, then copy the URL it gives you. If this is getting too technical and
you still want to connect your apps with Trivial Security there will be some
'click only' integrations made available in the planned updates, contact our
support for more information.
