Trivial Scanner is an open source project and designed to be modular, so you may
self-host the scanner and apply any number of rules.

Our Discord community can be a place to discover additional rules that have not
yet been added to the open source repository directly, and in future this site
will publicly publish user submitted rulesets for bespoke needs outside the core
projects goals.
