We strongly believe that all functionality and activities that occur within the
Trivial Security systems, related to your account, should be providing a webhook
event.

At launch the following event categories provide a webhook for a large set
underlying events;

-   Managed On-demand Trivial Scanner
-   Managed Monitoring of Trivial Scanner
-   Self-managed Trivial Scanner CLI interacting with Trivial Security systems
-   User activity that creates, modifies, or removes customer data - or security
    events
-   Early Warning System; when any of our threat intelligence matches a host in
    your account

If you identify any candidates for a new webhook please contact support and we
will evaluate the possibility of adding the event and prioritise development
effort if it is confirmed.
