Trivial Security applies to all (well-formed) HTTP requests it performs, the
User-Agent 'Trivial Scanner' for the open source tool, and 'Trivial Security'
for the hosted scanner.

We will act according to the directives in your robots.txt file at the root of
your domain.

If you are not a technical website owner, simply email support@trivialsec.com
with the subject "Opt-out" and include your hosts, we will still need to provide
you a verification token that you need to add as a TXT to your DNS (where the
domain name registration is maintained by you, the owner) to prove ownership.

Once opt-out verification is confirmed (once only) and we'll respectfully never
scan any subdomains or IP addresses (A and AAAA records), this is a permanent
opt-out, so if this is not desired then the better option is to utilize the
robots.txt file.

We plan to publish an rDNS record so you may lookup incoming IP Addresses of any
protocol to see if they are ours.

If you are a Trivial Security account holder we plan to include self-service
opt-out setting, if this is urgent please let us know to help us prioritize this
feature.
